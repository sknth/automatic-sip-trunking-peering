      <t>
The deployment of a Session Initiation Protocol <xref target="RFC3261" /> (SIP)-based
infrastructure in enterprise and service provider communication networks
is increasing at a rapid pace. Consequently, direct IP peering between
enterprise and service provider networks is quickly replacing
conventional methods of interconnection between enterprise and service
provider networks.

Currently published standards provide a strong foundation over which
direct IP peering can be realized. However, given the sheer number of
these standards, it is often not clear which behavioral subsets,
extensions to baseline protocols and operating principles ought to be
implemented by service provider and enterprise networks to ensure
successful peering.</t>
      <t>The SIP Connect technical recommendations  <xref target="SIP-Connect-TR" /> aim to solve this problem by
providing a central reference that promotes seamless peering between
enterprise and service provider SIP networks. However, despite the
extensive set of implementation rules and operating guidelines,
interoperability issues between service provider and enterprise networks
persist. This is in large part because service providers and equipment
manufacturers aren't required to enforce the guidelines of the technical
specifications and have a fair degree of freedom to deviate from them.
Consequently, enterprise administrators usually undertake a fairly
rigorous regimen of testing, analysis and troubleshooting to arrive at a
configuration block that ensures seamless service provider peering. However,
this workflow complements the SIP Connect technical recommendations, in
that both endeavours aim to promote/achieve interoperability between the
enterprise and service provider.
</t>
      <t>
Another set of interoperability problems arise when enterprise
administrators are required to translate a set of technical
recommendations from service providers to configuration blocks across
one or more devices in the enterprise network, which is usually an error prone
exercise. Additionally, such technical recommendations might not be
nuanced enough to intuitively allow the generation of specific
configuration blocks.
</t>
      <t>
This draft introduces a mechanism using which an enterprise network can
solicit a detailed capability set from a SIP service provider; the
detailed capability set can subsequently be used by automation or an
administrator to generate configuration blocks across one or more
devices within the enterprise network to ensure successful service provider
peering.

Figure 1 illustrates a reference architecture that may be deployed to
support the mechanism described in this document. The enterprise network
consists of a SIP-PBX, media endpoints (M.E.) and a Session Border Controller <xref target="RFC7092" />.
It may also include additional components such as application servers
for voicemail, recording, fax etc. At a high level, the service provider
consists of a SIP signaling entity (SP-SSE), a media entity for handling media streams of calls setup by the SP-SSE and a
HTTPS <xref target="RFC9110" /> server.

        <t>This draft makes use of the following terminology:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Enterprise Network: A communications network infrastructure deployed by an enterprise which interconnects with the service provider network over SIP. The enterprise network could include devices such as application servers, endpoints, call agents and edge devices, among others.</li>
          <li>Edge Device: A device that is the last hop in the enterprise network and that is the transit point for traffic entering and leaving the enterprise. An edge device is typically a back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) <xref target = "RFC7092" /> such as a Session Border Controller (SBC).</li>
          <li>Service Provider Network: A communications network infrastructure deployed by service providers. In the context of this draft, the service provider network is accessible over SIP for the establishment, modification and termination of calls and accessible over HTTPS for the transfer of the capability set document. The service provider network is also referred to as a SIP Service Provider (SSP) or Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP) network.</li>
          <li>Call Control: Call Control within a telephony networks refers to software that is responsible for delivering its core functionality. Call control not only provides the basic functionality of setting up, sustaining and terminating calls, but also provides the necessary control and logic required for additional services within the telephony network, such as, registration of endpoints, integration with application servers (voicemail, instant messaging, presence), among others.</li>
          <li>Capability Server: A server hosted in the service provider network, such that this server is the target for capability set document requests from the enterprise network.</li>
          <li>Capability Set: The term capability set (or capability set document) refers collectively to a set of characteristics within the service provider network, which when communicated to the enterprise network, provides the enterprise network the information required to interconnect with the service provider network. The various parameters that constitute the capability set relate to characteristics that are specific to signalling, media, transport and security. Certain aspects of interconnecting with service providers are out of scope of the capability set; for example, the access technology used to interconnect with service provider networks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section anchor="configuration-workflow" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Configuration Workflow</name>
        <t>A workflow that facilitates an enterprise network to solicit the capability set of a SIP service provider ought to take into account the following considerations:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The configuration workflow must be based on a protocol or a set of protocols commonly used between enterprise and service provider telephony networks.</li>
          <li>
            <t>The configuration workflow must be flexible enough to allow the service provider network to dynamically offload different capability sets to different enterprise networks based on the identity of the enterprise network.</t>
            <t/>
          </li>
          <li>Capability set documents obtained as a result of the configuration workflow must be conducive to easy parsing by automation. Subsequently, automation may be used for the generation of appropriate configuration blocks on the edge element or across one or more elements in the enterprise network.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Taking the above considerations into account, this document proposes a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)-based workflow using which the enterprise network can solicit and ultimately obtain the service provider capability set. The enterprise network creates a well formed HTTP GET request to solicit the service provider capability set. Subsequently, the HTTPS response from the SIP service provider includes the capability set. The capability set is encoded in JSON, thus ensuring that the response can be easily parsed by automation.</t>
        <t>There are alternative mechanisms using which the SIP service provider can offload its capability set. For example, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be extended to define a new event package <xref target = "RFC6665" />, such that the enterprise network can establish a SIP subscription with the service provider for its capability set; the SIP service provider can subsequently use the SIP NOTIFY request to communicate its capability set or any state deltas to its baseline capability set.</t>
        <t>This mechanism is likely to result in a barrier to adoption for SIP service providers and enterprise networks as equipment manufacturers would have to first add support for such a SIP extension. A HTTPS-based approach would be relatively easier to adopt as most edge devices deployed in enterprise networks today already support HTTPS; from the perspective of service provider networks, all that is required is for them to deploy HTTPS servers that function as capability servers. Additionally, most SIP service providers require enterprise networks to register with them (using a SIP REGISTER message) before any other SIP methods that initiate subscriptions (SIP SUBSCRIBE) or calls (SIP INVITE) are processed. As a result, a SIP-based framework to obtain a capability set would require operational changes on the part of service provider networks.</t>
        <t>Yet another example of an alternative mechanism would be for service providers and enterprise equipment manufacturers to agree on YANG models <xref target = "RFC6020" /> that enable configuration to be pushed over NETCONF <xref target = "RFC6241" /> to enterprise networks from a centralised source hosted in service provider networks. The presence of proprietary software logic for call and media handling in enterprise devices would preclude the generation of a "one-size-fits-all" YANG model. Additionally, service provider networks pushing configuration to enterprises devices might lead to the loss of implementation autonomy on the part of the enterprise network.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="transport" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Transport</name>
        <t>To solicit the capability set of a SIP service provider, the edge element in an enterprise network generates a well-formed HTTP GET request. There are two reasons why it makes sense for the enterprise edge element to generate the HTTPS request:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Edge elements are devices that normalise any mismatches between the enterprise and service provider networks in the media and signaling planes. As a result, when the capability set is received from the SIP service provider network, the edge element can generate appropriate configuration blocks (possibly across multiple devices) to enable interconnection.</li>
          <li>Given that edge elements are configured to "talk" to networks external to the enterprise, the complexity in terms of NAT traversal and firewall configuration would be minimal.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>The HTTP GET request is targeted at a capability server that is managed by the SIP service provider such that this server processes, and on successfully processing the request, includes the capability set document in the response. The capability set document is constructed according the guidelines of the YANG model described in this draft. The capability set document included in a successful response is formatted in JSON. More details about the formatting of the HTTP request and response are provided in Section 4.</t>
        <t>There could be situations wherein an enterprise telephony network interconnects with its SIP service provider such that traffic between the two networks traverses an intermediary SIP service provider network. This could be a result of interconnect agreements between the terminating and transit SIP service provider networks. In such situations, the capability set provided to the enterprise network by its SIP service provider must account for the characteristics of the transit SIP service provider network from a signalling and media perspective. For example, if the terminating SIP service provider network supports the G.729 codec and the transit SIP service provider network does not, G.729 must not be advertised in the capability set. As another example, if the transit SIP service provider network doesn't support a SIP extension, for instance, the SIP extension for Reliable Provisional Responses as defined in RFC 3262, the terminating SIP service provider network must not advertise support for this extension in the capability set provided to the enterprise network. How a terminating SIP service provider obtains the characteristics of the intermediary SIP service provider network is out of the scope of this document; however, one method could be for the terminating SIP service provider to obtain the characteristics of the intermediary SIP service provider by leveraging the YANG model introduced in this document.</t>

        <t>Peering requests and responses are defined over HTTP <xref target = "RFC9110" />. However, due to the sensitive nature of information transmitted between client and server, it is required to secure HTTP communications using Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC8446" />; therefore the enterprise edge element and the capability server MUST support TLS. When HTTP/3 is used, TLS is incorporated within QUIC. Additionally, the enterprise edge element and capability server MUST support the use of the HTTP URI scheme as defined in <xref target="RFC9110" />.</t>

      <section anchor="authenticated-client-identity" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Authenticated Client Identity</name>
        <t>HTTP usually adopts asymmetric methods of authentication. For example, clients typically use certificate based authentication to verify the server they are talking to, whereas, servers typically use methods such as HTTP digest authentication or OAuth2.0 <xref target="RFC6749" /> to authenticate clients. Though OAuth2.0 is not an authentication protocol, it nonetheless allows for client authentication to be carried out with the use of OAuth tokens.  </t>
        <t>In the context of the SIP Auto Peer framework, OAuth2.0 MUST be used to carry out client authentication. Enterprise edge elements that obtain the capability set document from SIP service providers could have differing capabilities in terms of adhering to a specific OAuth2.0 authorisation grant flow. For example, an SBC that is configured and managed through a CLI and that does not have the ability to launch a web-browser wouldn't be able to obtain an authorisation code and subsequently an access token. Alternatively, an SBC that is configured and managed via a GUI could redirect an administrator to an appropriate OAuth2.0 authorisation server to obtain an authorisation grant and subsequently an access token. In order to ensure that OAuth2.0-based client authentication can be carried out irrespective of enterprise edge element capabilities, this draft requires that the Resource Owner Password Credentials grant type be supported. </t>
        <t>Using the resource owner password credentials grant type requires the existence of a trust relationship between the resource owner (in this context, the administrator/enterprise network) and the client (in this context, an edge element such as an SBC). In SIP trunking deployments between enterprise and service provider networks, such a trust relationship between the administrator/resource owner/enterprise network and the client (edge element) already exists, as SIP trunk registration (and refreshing registrations) require credentials - typically a username and password, that are configured on the edge element by the administrator.</t>
        <t>The use of the resource owner credential grant type in the context of the SIP Auto Peer framework, provides two advantages:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>It enables OAuth2.0-based client authentication even in deployments in wherein the edge element is not capable of launching a web-browser to set in motion the authorisation code grant flow of OAuth2.0</li>
          <li><t>For situations in which a refresh token is not provided by the authorisation endpoint, human/administrator involvement is not required to obtain fresh tokens once an existing token expires. Figure 2 provides a high-level diagrammatic illustration of how OAuth2.0-based client authentication is achieved using resource owner credentials in the context of SIP Auto Peer. </t></li>

          <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>The enterprise SBC stores the enterprise credentials required to authenticate with the authorization server located in the service provider network. These credentials may be passed to the enterprise from the service provider in an out-of-band fashion such as an email or a self-management service provided by the service provider to the enterprise.</li>
          <li>The enterprise SBC contacts the service provider authorization server to obtain an access token using the credentials acquired in Step 1.</li>
          <li>The service provider authorization server ratifies the credentials and grants the access token to the enterprise SBC. The server could also provide a refresh token to the SBC to regenerate the access token in the future.</li>
          <li>The enterprise SBC then contacts the capability server located in the service provider network with an HTTP GET request along with the access token to retrieve the capability set document.</li>
          <li>The capability server checks for a valid access token and returns the capability set document to the enterprise SBC. The service provider will host a unique document for each enterprise network that will peer with it.</li>

      <t>Given that the service provider capability set is largely expected to remain static, the work needed to implement an asynchronous push mechanism to encode minor changes in the capability set document (state deltas) is not commensurate with the benefits. Rather, enterprise edge elements can poll capability servers at pre-defined intervals to obtain the full capability set document. It is recommended that capability servers are polled every 24 hours.</t>

      <name>Encoding the Service Provider Capability Set</name>
      <t>In the context of this draft, the capability set of a service provider refers collectively to a set of characteristics which when communicated to an enterprise network, provides it with sufficient information to directly peer with the service provider network. The capability set document is not designed to encode extremely granular details of all features, services, and protocol extensions that are supported by the service provider network. For example, it is sufficient to encode that the service provider uses T.38 relay for faxing, it is not required to know the value of the "T38FaxFillBitRemoval" parameter.</t>
      <t>The parameters within the capability set document represent a wide array of characteristics, such that these characteristics collectively disseminate sufficient information to enable direct IP peering between enterprise and service provider networks. The various parameters represented in the capability set are chosen based on existing practises and common problem sets typically seen between enterprise and service provider SIP networks.</t>

There are situations in which equipment manufactures or service
providers would benefit from extending the YANG module defined in this
draft. For example, service providers could extend the YANG module to
include information that further simplifies direct IP peering. Such
information could include: trunk group identifiers, customer/enterprise
account numbers, service provider support numbers, among others.

Extension of the module can be achieved by importing the module defined
in this draft. An example is provided below:

Consider a new YANG module "vendorA" specified for VendorA's enterprise
SBC. The "vendorA-config" YANG module is configured as follows:

        description "Initial revision of VendorA Enterprise SBC
        configuration data model";

      }
    }

        <t>

In the example above, a custom module named "vendorA-config" uses the

the module defined in this draft.

      <name>Processing the Capability Set Response</name>
      <t>This section provides a non-normative description of the procedures that could be carried out by the enterprise network after obtaining the SIP service provider capability set. On obtaining the capability set, the enterprise edge element can parse the various fields within the capability set and generate configuration blocks. For example, the configuration required to successfully register a SIP trunk with the SIP registrar hosted in the service provider network, the configuration required to ensure that fax calls are handled appropriately, the configuration required to advertise only audio codecs supported by the SIP service provider, among many other configuration blocks. A configuration block generated for an almost identical SIP service provider capability set document is likely going to differ drastically from one vendor to the next. </t>
      <t>Enterprise edge elements are usually capable of normalising mismatches in the signalling and media planes between the enterprise and service provider SIP networks. As a result, most, if not all of the configuration blocks required to enable successful SIP service provider peering might need to be added on the edge element. In situations wherein configuration blocks need to be distributed across multiple devices, some mechanism, that is out of scope of this document might be used to communicate the specific fields of capacity set and their corresponding value. Alternatively, a human administrator could go through the capability set document and configure the edge element (and if required, other devices in the enterprise network appropriately.</t>

This section provides examples of how capability set documents that
leverage the YANG module defined in this document can be encoded over
JSON as well as the exchange of messages between the enterprise
edge element and the service provider to acquire the capability set
document. The service provider will create a unique document for each enterprise
network that will peer with it.

This section is an informational example depicting the configuration flow that
ultimately results in the enterprise edge element obtaining the
capability set document from the SIP service provider.

Assuming the enterprise edge element has been pre-configured with the
request target for the capability set document or has dynamically
found the request target, the edge element generates a HTTP GET request.
This request can be challenged by the service provider to authenticate
the enterprise.

</t>
        <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[

    Host: capserver.ssp1.com
    Accept:application/peering-info+json
]]></artwork>
        <t>

The capability set document is obtained in the body of the response and
is encoded in JSON.

      <t>
The capability set document contains sensitive information that must be protected
from attackers. A capability set document leak can inflict considerable damage to
both the enterprise as well as the service provider. An attacker that gains access
to the capability set document can cause problems in multiple ways.</t>
<t>There are multiple attack points in the ASAP workflow. The sections below deal with
the different points at which the workflow is vulnerable to attackers.</t>
<section anchor="security-considerations-authentication" numbered="true" toc="default">
<name>OAuth Credentials</name>
<t>In scenarios wherein client authentication is carried out using OAuth resource owner credentials, it is required to ensure that these credentials cannot be acquired by any unauthorised third-party. If acquired by an unauthorised third-party, these credentials may be used to obtain the capability set document from the SIP service provider and subsequently use the information in such a document to make unauthorised calls while posing as an enterprise telephony network that has legitimately paid for calling services from a SIP service provider.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations-transmission" numbered="true" toc="default">
  <name>Client-Server Communication</name>
  <t>All communication used by the edge element to obtain the capability set document from the capability server MUST be secured using HTTPS. Failure to do so, results in the capability set document being transmitted over clear text, thus exposing sensitive information such as targets for trunks registration, targets for outbound calling requests and credentials used in building the Authorisation header field provided in response to authentication challenges. </t>
</section>
<!-- <section anchor="security-considerations-capability-set" numbered="true" toc="default">
  <name>Capability Set</name>
<ul spacing="normal">
	<li>The attacker can use the "registrar" field in the "transport-info" section of the capability
	set to register a single or a series of endpoints with the service provider
	while pretending to be the enterprise. The "callControl" field provides a list of destinations
	that the attacker could make calls to. The attacker can also rack up considerable
	bills for the enterprise by making outgoing calls to expensive destinations via the service
	provider network such as international calls. The attacker also has information of hosts within the
	service provider network. This opens avenues such as network and vulnerability scanning, targeted
	as well as DDoS attacks on servers in the service provider network.</li>
	<li>The "call-specs" and "media" sections of the document provide information on the capabilities
	supported by the service provider network as well as valid phone numbers belonging to the enterprise.
	The attacker can leverage this information to craft SIP and SDP signaling messages in order to place
	calls towards the destinations mentioned above.</li>
	<li>The attacker will also be able to place secure calls over TLS and SRTP with the information in
	the "security" section of the capability set document.</li>

</ul>
</section> -->
<!-- <section anchor="security-considerations-storage" numbered="true" toc="default">
<name>Storage</name>
<t>The service provider MUST encrypt the capability set documents in their respective capability
 servers if they generate the documents for their customers before-hand. In a scenario where a
 capability server in the service provider network is compromised, an attacker will not be able
 to steal capability set documents and use them for malicious purposes.</t>
 <t>One method to avoid having to encrypt files is for the service provider to generate the
  capability set documents on-demand by leveraging automation. When the capability server
  receives a request to download the capability set from an enterprise, a script can generate
  the capability set document for the respective enterprise. The capability server can then
  return this document to the enterprise over a secure channel.</t>
