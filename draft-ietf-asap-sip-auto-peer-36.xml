      <t>
The deployment of a Session Initiation Protocol <xref target="RFC3261" /> (SIP)-based
infrastructure in enterprise and service provider communication networks
is increasing at a rapid pace. Consequently, direct IP peering between
enterprise and service provider networks is quickly replacing
conventional methods of interconnection between enterprise and service
provider networks.

Currently published standards provide a strong foundation over which
direct IP peering can be realized. However, given the sheer number of
these standards, it is often not clear which behavioral subsets,
extensions to baseline protocols and operating principles ought to be
implemented by service provider and enterprise networks to ensure
successful peering.</t>
      <t>The SIP Connect technical recommendations  <xref target="SIP-Connect-TR" /> aim to solve this problem by
providing a central reference that promotes seamless peering between
enterprise and service provider SIP networks. However, despite the
extensive set of implementation rules and operating guidelines,
interoperability issues between service provider and enterprise networks
persist. This is in large part because the guidelines of the technical
specifications aren't hard requirements that can be enforced by the peer.
Consequently, enterprise administrators usually undertake a fairly
rigorous regimen of testing, analysis and troubleshooting to arrive at a
configuration block that ensures seamless service provider peering. However,
this workflow complements the SIP Connect technical recommendations, in
that both endeavours aim to promote/achieve interoperability between the
enterprise and service provider.
</t>
      <t>
Another set of interoperability problems arise when enterprise
administrators are required to translate a set of technical
recommendations from service providers to configuration blocks across
one or more devices in the enterprise network, which is usually an error prone
exercise. Additionally, such technical recommendations might not be
nuanced enough to intuitively allow the generation of specific
configuration blocks.
</t>
      <t>
This draft introduces the SIP Auto Peer framework by which an enterprise network can
solicit a detailed capability set from a SIP service provider; the
detailed capability set can subsequently be used by automation or an
administrator to generate configuration blocks across one or more
devices within the enterprise network to ensure successful service provider
peering.

Figure 1 illustrates a reference architecture that may be deployed to
support the mechanism described in this document. The enterprise network
consists of a SIP-PBX, media endpoints (M.E.) and a Session Border Controller <xref target="RFC7092" />.
It may also include additional components such as application servers
for voicemail, recording, fax etc. At a high level, the service provider
consists of a SIP signaling entity (SP-SSE), a media entity for handling media streams of calls setup by the SP-SSE and a https <xref target="RFC9110" /> server.

        <t>This draft makes use of the following terminology:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Enterprise Network: A communications network infrastructure deployed by an enterprise which interconnects with the service provider network over SIP. The enterprise network could include devices such as application servers, endpoints, call agents and edge devices, among others.</li>
          <li>Edge Device: A device that is the last hop in the enterprise network and that is the transit point for traffic entering and leaving the enterprise. An edge device is typically a back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) <xref target = "RFC7092" /> such as a Session Border Controller (SBC).</li>
          <li>Service Provider Network: A communications network infrastructure deployed by service providers. In the context of this draft, the service provider network is accessible over SIP for the establishment, modification and termination of calls and accessible over HTTP for the transfer of the capability set document. The service provider network is also referred to as a SIP Service Provider (SSP) or Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP) network.</li>
          <li>Call Control: Call Control within a telephony networks refers to software that is responsible for delivering core telephony functions. Call control not only provides the basic functionality of setting up, sustaining and terminating calls, but also provides the necessary control and logic required for additional services within the telephony network, such as, registration of endpoints, integration with application servers (voicemail, instant messaging, presence), among others.</li>
          <li>Capability Server: A server hosted in the service provider network, such that this server is the target for capability set document requests from the enterprise network.</li>
          <li>Capability Set: The term capability set (or capability set document) refers collectively to a set of characteristics within the service provider network, which when communicated to the enterprise network, provides the enterprise network the information required to interconnect with the service provider network. The various parameters that constitute the capability set relate to characteristics that are specific to signalling, media, transport and security. Certain aspects of interconnecting with service providers are out of scope of the capability set; for example, the access technology used to interconnect with service provider networks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section anchor="configuration-workflow" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Configuration Workflow</name>
        <t>A workflow that enables an enterprise network to solicit the capability set of a SIP service provider ought to take into account the following considerations:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The configuration workflow must be based on a protocol or a set of protocols commonly used between enterprise and service provider telephony networks.</li>
          <li>
            <t>The configuration workflow must be flexible enough to allow the service provider network to dynamically offload different capability sets to different enterprise networks based on the identity of the enterprise network.</t>
            <t/>
          </li>
          <li>Capability set documents obtained as a result of the configuration workflow must be conducive to easy parsing by automation. Subsequently, automation may be used for the generation of appropriate configuration blocks on the edge element or across one or more elements in the enterprise network.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Taking the above considerations into account, this document proposes a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)-based workflow using which the enterprise network can solicit and ultimately obtain the service provider capability set. The enterprise network creates a well formed HTTP GET request to solicit the service provider capability set. Subsequently, the HTTP response from the SIP service provider includes the capability set. The capability set is encoded in JSON, thus ensuring that the response can be easily parsed by automation.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="transport" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Transport</name>
        <t>To solicit the capability set of a SIP service provider, the edge element in an enterprise network generates a well-formed HTTP GET request. There are two reasons why it makes sense for the enterprise edge element to generate the HTTP request:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>Edge elements are devices that normalise any mismatches between the enterprise and service provider networks in the media and signaling planes. As a result, when the capability set is received from the SIP service provider network, the edge element can generate appropriate configuration blocks (possibly across multiple devices) to enable interconnection.</li>
          <li>Given that edge elements are configured to "talk" to networks external to the enterprise, the complexity in terms of NAT traversal and firewall configuration would be minimal.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>The HTTP GET request is targeted at a capability server that is managed by the SIP service provider such that this server processes, and on successfully processing the request, includes the capability set document in the response. The capability set document is constructed according to the guidelines of the YANG model described in this draft. The capability set document included in a successful response is formatted in JSON. More details about the formatting of the HTTP request and response are provided in Section 4.</t>
        <t>There could be situations wherein an enterprise telephony network interconnects with its SIP service provider such that traffic between the two networks traverses an intermediary SIP service provider network. This could be a result of interconnect agreements between the terminating and transit SIP service provider networks. In such situations, the capability set provided to the enterprise network by its SIP service provider must account for the characteristics of the transit SIP service provider network from a signalling and media perspective. For example, if the terminating SIP service provider network supports the G.729 codec and the transit SIP service provider network does not, G.729 must not be advertised in the capability set. As another example, if the transit SIP service provider network doesn't support a SIP extension, for instance, the SIP extension for Reliable Provisional Responses as defined in <xref target = "RFC3262" />, the terminating SIP service provider network must not advertise support for this extension in the capability set provided to the enterprise network. How a terminating SIP service provider obtains the characteristics of the intermediary SIP service provider network is out of the scope of this document; however, one method could be for the terminating SIP service provider to obtain the characteristics of the intermediary SIP service provider by leveraging the YANG model introduced in this document.</t>

        <t>Peering requests and responses are defined over HTTP <xref target = "RFC9110" />. However, due to the sensitive nature of information transmitted between client and server, it is required to secure HTTP communications using Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC8446" />; therefore the enterprise edge element and the capability server MUST support TLS. When HTTP/3 <xref target="RFC9114" /> is used, TLS is incorporated within QUIC for the transport of the capability set document. The usage of SIP or RTP-over-QUIC are beyond the scope of this draft. Additionally, the enterprise edge element and capability server MUST support the use of the https URI scheme as defined in <xref target="RFC9110" />.</t>

      <section anchor="authenticated-client-identity" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Authenticated Client Identity</name>
        <t>HTTP usually adopts asymmetric methods of authentication. For example, clients typically use certificate based authentication to verify the server they are talking to, whereas, servers typically use methods such as HTTP digest authentication or OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749" /> to authenticate clients. Though OAuth 2.0 is not an authentication protocol, it nonetheless allows for client authentication to be carried out with the use of OAuth tokens.  </t>
        <t>In the context of the SIP Auto Peer framework, OAuth 2.0 MUST be used to carry out client authentication. Enterprise edge elements could use the various grant types outlined in the OAuth 2.0 specification and supported by the service provider in order to obtain the capability set document. This draft does not mandate a specific grant type. The implementation of OAuth 2.0 to obtain the capability set are beyond the scope of this document. However, it provides an example of how an enterprise SBC could leverage the "Authorization Code Grant" (<xref target="RFC6749" sectionFormat="of" section="4.1" />) flow to acquire the capability set document from the service provider in Figure 2.</t> 
        <t>Using the "Resource Owner Password Credentials" grant type (<xref target="RFC6749" sectionFormat="of" section="1.3.3" />) requires the existence of a trust relationship between the resource owner (in this context, the administrator/enterprise network) and the client (in this context, an edge element such as an SBC). In SIP trunking deployments between enterprise and service provider networks, such a trust relationship between the administrator/resource owner/enterprise network and the client (edge element) already exists, as SIP trunk registration (and refreshing registrations) require credentials - typically a username and password, that are configured on the edge element by the administrator. However, it is important for the enterprise network administrator and service provider to factor in security issues associated with this grant type.</t>

    Figure 2: Client Authentication Mechanism

      <t>The flow illustrated in Figure 2 includes the following steps:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="A">
          <li>The enterprise SBC (client) initiates the flow by directing the resource owner's (enterprise network administrator) user-agent to the authorization endpoint. The SBC includes its client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a redirection URI to which the authorization server will send the user-agent back once access is granted (or denied). As a precursor to the flow, the enterprise network administrator has already obtained a unique client identifier for their network and provided a redirection URI populated with a target within their network to obtain the authorization code.</li>
          <li>The authorization server within the service provider network authenticates the network administrator (via the user-agent) and establishes whether the network administrator grants or denies the client's access request.</li>
          <li>Assuming the network administrator grants access, the authorization server redirects the user-agent back to the enterprise SBC using the redirection URI provided earlier (in the request or during client registration).  The redirection URI includes an authorization code and any local state provided by the client earlier.</li>
          <li>The enterprise SBC requests an access token from the authorization server's token endpoint by including the authorization code received in the previous step. When making the request, the enterprise SBC authenticates with the authorization server and includes the redirection URI used to obtain the authorization code for verification. </li>
          <li>The authorization server authenticates the enterprise SBC, validates the authorization code, and ensures that the redirection URI received matches the URI used to redirect the SBC in step (C).  If valid, the authorization server responds back with an access token and, optionally, a refresh token.</li>
          <li>The enterprise SBC then contacts the capability server located in the service provider network with an HTTP GET request along with the access token to retrieve the capability set document.</li>
          <li>The capability server checks for a valid access token and returns the capability set document to the enterprise SBC. The service provider will host a unique document for each enterprise network that will peer with it.</li>

      <t>Given that the service provider capability set is largely expected to remain static, the work needed to implement an asynchronous push mechanism to encode minor changes in the capability set document (state deltas) is not commensurate with the benefits. Rather, enterprise edge elements can poll capability servers at pre-defined intervals to obtain the full capability set document. It is recommended that capability servers are polled every 24 hours. Alternatively, the enterprise edge elements can leverage Preconditions specified in <xref target = "RFC9110" /> to conditionally retrieve the capability set document if any changes have occurred.</t>

      <name>Encoding the Service Provider Capability Set</name>
      <t>In the context of this draft, the capability set of a service provider refers collectively to a set of characteristics which when communicated to an enterprise network, provides it with sufficient information to directly peer with the service provider network. The capability set document is not designed to encode extremely granular details of all features, services, and protocol extensions that are supported by the service provider network. For example, it is sufficient to encode that the service provider uses T.38 relay for faxing, it is not required to know the value of the "T38FaxFillBitRemoval" parameter.</t>
      <t>The parameters within the capability set document represent a wide array of characteristics, such that these characteristics collectively disseminate sufficient information to enable direct IP peering between enterprise and service provider networks. The various parameters represented in the capability set are chosen based on existing practises and common problem sets typically seen between enterprise and service provider SIP networks.</t>

    "Data model for encoding SIP Service Provider Capability Set.

    This YANG module defines a read-only data model intended for
    exchanging SIP service provider capabilities with enterprise
    networks. The data is published by service providers and
    consumed by enterprises via standard YANG-based interfaces
    (RESTCONF, NETCONF, etc.).

    This module does NOT provide configuration capabilities - it
    serves purely as a standardized format for capability exchange.
    Service providers generate and host capability documents based
    on this schema, which enterprises retrieve and use to configure
    their SIP equipment.

There are situations in which equipment manufactures or service
providers would benefit from extending the YANG module defined in this
draft. For example, service providers could extend the YANG module to
include information that further simplifies direct IP peering. Such
information could include: trunk group identifiers, customer/enterprise
account numbers, service provider support numbers, among others.

Extension of the module can be achieved by importing the module defined
in this draft. An example is provided below:

Consider a new YANG module "vendorA" specified for VendorA's enterprise
SBC. The "vendorA-config" YANG module is configured as follows:

</t>
    <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
    module vendorA-config {
      namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:vendorA-config";
      prefix "vendorA";

      description
      "Data model for configuring VendorA Enterprise SBC";

      revision 2020-05-06 {
        description "Initial revision of VendorA Enterprise SBC
        configuration data model";
      }

      import ietf-sip-auto-peering {
        prefix "peering";
      }

      augment "/peering:sip-auto-peering" {
        container vendorAConfig {
          leaf vendorAConfigParam1 {
            type int32;
            description "vendorA configuration parameter 1
            (SBC Device ID)";
          }

          leaf vendorAConfigParam2 {
            type string;
              description "vendorA configuration parameter 2
              (SBC Device name)";
          }
          description "Container for vendorA SBC configuration";
        }
      }
    }
]]></artwork>
        <t>

In the example above, a custom module named "vendorA-config" uses the
"augment" statement as defined in Section 4.2.8 of <xref target = "RFC7950" /> to extend
the module defined in this draft.

      <name>Processing the Capability Set Response</name>
      <t>This section provides a non-normative description of the procedures that could be carried out by the enterprise network after obtaining the SIP service provider capability set. On obtaining the capability set, the enterprise edge element can parse the various fields within the capability set and generate configuration blocks. For example, the configuration required to successfully register a SIP trunk with the SIP registrar hosted in the service provider network, the configuration required to ensure that fax calls are handled appropriately, the configuration required to advertise only audio codecs supported by the SIP service provider, among many other configuration blocks. A configuration block generated for an almost identical SIP service provider capability set document is likely going to differ drastically from one vendor to the next. </t>
      <t>Enterprise edge elements are usually capable of normalising mismatches in the signalling and media planes between the enterprise and service provider SIP networks. As a result, most, if not all of the configuration blocks required to enable successful SIP service provider peering might need to be added on the edge element. In situations wherein configuration blocks need to be distributed across multiple devices, some mechanism, that is out of scope of this document might be used to communicate the specific fields of capacity set and their corresponding value. Alternatively, a human administrator could go through the capability set document and configure the edge element (and if required, other devices in the enterprise network appropriately.</t>

This section provides examples of how capability set documents that
leverage the YANG module defined in this document can be encoded over
JSON as well as the exchange of messages between the enterprise
edge element and the service provider to acquire the capability set
document. The service provider will create a unique document for each enterprise
network that will peer with it.

This section is an informational example depicting the configuration flow that
ultimately results in the enterprise edge element obtaining the
capability set document from the SIP service provider.

Assuming the enterprise edge element has been pre-configured with the
request target for the capability set document or has dynamically
found the request target, the edge element generates a HTTP GET request.
This request can be challenged by the service provider to authenticate
the enterprise.

      is available from the Appendix section of this document.</t>

      <t>IANA is requested to add this note to the registry:</t>

          <t>New values must not be directly added to the "iana-sip-option-tags" YANG
          module.  They must instead be added to the "Option Tags" registry located at
          https://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters/sip-parameters.xhtml.</t>

      <t>When a value is added to the "Option Tags" registry, a new "enum" statement
      must be added to the "iana-sip-option-tags" YANG module.  The "enum" statement,
      and sub-statements thereof, should be defined:</t>

      <ul>
      <li>"enum":        Replicates a name from the registry.</li>
      <li>"description":  Replicates the description from the registry.</li>

      <t>Unassigned or reserved values are not present in the module.</t>

      <t>When the "iana-sip-option-tags" YANG module is updated, a new "revision"
      statement with a unique revision date needs to be added in front of
      the existing revision statements. The "revision" statement MUST
      contain both "description" and "reference" substatements as follows.</t>

      <t>The "description" substatement captures what changed in the
      revised version. Typically, the description enumerates the changes
      such as udpates to existing entries (e.g., update a description or
      a reference) or notes which "enums" were added or had their status
      changed (e.g., deprecated, discouraged, or obsoleted).</t>

      
      <t>-- When such a description is not feasible, the description varies on how the update is triggered.</t>

      <t>-- If the update is triggered by an RFC, insert this text:</t>

      <t>The "description" substatement should include this text:
      "Applied updates as specified by RFC XXXX.".</t>

      <t>-- If the update is triggered following other IANA registration
      -- policy (Section 4 of [RFC8126]) but not all the values in the
      -- registry are covered by the same policy, insert this text:</t>

      <t>The "description" substatement should include this text:
      "Applied updates as specified by the registration policy Some_IANA_policy".</t>

      <t>The "reference" substatement points specifically to the published
      module (i.e., IANA_SIP_OPTION_TAGS_URL_With_REV). It may also point to an
      authoritative event triggering the update to the YANG module. In all
      cases, this event is cited from the underlying IANA registry. If the
      update is triggered by an RFC, that RFC must also be included in
      the "reference" substatement.</t>

      <t>-- If a name in the IANA registry does not comply with the
        -- YANG naming conventions, add details how IANA can generate
        -- legal identifiers. For example, if the name begins with
        -- a number, indicate a preference to spell out the number when
        -- used as an identifier.</t>

      <t>IANA is requested to add this note to [reference-to-the-iana-sip-option-tags-
      registry]:</t>

        <t>When this registry is modified, the YANG module "iana-sip-option-tags"

  <t>The "ietf-sip-auto-peering" YANG module defines a data model that is
designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241" /> and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040" />. These YANG-based management protocols (1) have to use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH <xref target="RFC4252" />, TLS <xref target="RFC8446" />, and QUIC <xref target="RFC9000" />) and (2) have to use mutual authentication.</t>

<t>There are no particularly sensitive writable data nodes.</t>

<t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
notification) to these data nodes. Specifically, the following
subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
vulnerabilities:</t>

<ul spacing="normal">
	<li>registrar: This list contains IP addresses or hostnames belonging to registration servers in the service provider network, which may be targeted by malicious actors.</li>
	<li>realms: This list contains sensitive credentials that are utilized by the enterprise to create a registration with the service provider's network. The registration is a pre-requisite to making and receiving calls to and from the service provider respectively.</li>
	<li>call-control: This list contains IP addresses or hostnames belonging to call processing servers in the sevice provider network, which may be targeted by malicious actors.</li>
  <li>outbound-proxy: This list contains IP addresses or hostnames belonging to SIP proxies in the sevice provider network, which may be targeted by malicious actors.</li>
  <li>number-range: This list contains a range of phone numbers allocated by the service provider to an enterprise that the service provider may want conceal from other enterprises or customers.</li>
</ul>

<t>There are no particularly sensitive RPC or action operations.</t>

<t>This YANG module uses groupings from other YANG modules that

	<li>The attacker can use the "registrar" field in the "transport-info" section of the capability
	set to register a single or a series of endpoints with the service provider
	while pretending to be the enterprise. The "callControl" field provides a list of destinations
	that the attacker could make calls to. The attacker can also rack up considerable
	bills for the enterprise by making outgoing calls to expensive destinations via the service
	provider network such as international calls. The attacker also has information of hosts within the
	service provider network. This opens avenues such as network and vulnerability scanning, targeted
	as well as DDoS attacks on servers in the service provider network.</li>
	<li>The "call-specs" and "media" sections of the document provide information on the capabilities
	supported by the service provider network as well as valid phone numbers belonging to the enterprise.
	The attacker can leverage this information to craft SIP and SDP signaling messages in order to place
	calls towards the destinations mentioned above.</li>
	<li>The attacker will also be able to place secure calls over TLS and SRTP with the information in
	the "security" section of the capability set document.</li>

<t>The service provider MUST encrypt the capability set documents in their respective capability
 servers if they generate the documents for their customers before-hand. In a scenario where a
 capability server in the service provider network is compromised, an attacker will not be able
 to steal capability set documents and use them for malicious purposes.</t>
 <t>One method to avoid having to encrypt files is for the service provider to generate the
  capability set documents on-demand by leveraging automation. When the capability server
  receives a request to download the capability set from an enterprise, a script can generate
  the capability set document for the respective enterprise. The capability server can then
  return this document to the enterprise over a secure channel.</t>

      <name>Alternative mechanisms to transmit the capability set</name>
    <t>There are alternative mechanisms using which the SIP service provider can offload its capability set. For example, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be extended to define a new event package <xref target = "RFC6665" />, such that the enterprise network can establish a SIP subscription with the service provider for its capability set; the SIP service provider can subsequently use the SIP NOTIFY request to communicate its capability set or any state deltas to its baseline capability set.</t>
        <t>This mechanism is likely to result in a barrier to adoption for SIP service providers and enterprise networks as equipment manufacturers would have to first add support for such a SIP extension. An HTTP-based approach would be relatively easier to adopt as most edge devices deployed in enterprise networks today already support HTTP; from the perspective of service provider networks, all that is required is for them to deploy HTTP servers that function as capability servers. Additionally, most SIP service providers require enterprise networks to register with them (using a SIP REGISTER message) before any other SIP methods that initiate subscriptions (SIP SUBSCRIBE) or calls (SIP INVITE) are processed. As a result, a SIP-based framework to obtain a capability set would require operational changes on the part of service provider networks.</t>
        <t> Yet another example of an alternative mechanism would be for service providers and enterprise equipment manufacturers to agree on YANG models <xref target = "RFC6020" /><xref target = "RFC7950" /> that enable configuration to be pushed over NETCONF<xref target = "RFC6241" /> to enterprise networks from a centralised source hosted in service provider networks. The presence of proprietary software logic for call and media handling in enterprise devices would preclude the generation of a "one-size-fits-all" YANG model. Additionally, service provider networks pushing configuration to enterprises devices might lead to the loss of implementation autonomy on the part of the enterprise network.</t>
